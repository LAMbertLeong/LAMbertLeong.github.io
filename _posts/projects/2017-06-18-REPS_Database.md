__Summary__

The Research and Evaluation in Public Safety project (REPS) is a project under
the [Social Science Research
Institute](http://ssri.manoa.hawaii.edu/faculty-research/) (SSRI) at the
University of Hawaii at Manoa.  Their research is focused on the effect
correctional programs have on recidivism of incarcerated individuals.  Inmate
evaluation and progress is measured by a Level of Service Inventory-Revised
([LSI-R](https://www.mhs.com/MHS-Publicsafety?prodname=lsi-r)) tests in which
inmates receive scores which indicate their level of risk of recidivism.  The
researchers at REPS use statistical analysis to evaluate correlations in the
data such as correlating inmate demographics with LSI-R score.  Evaluating
correlations were difficult because different data for a particular inmate was
housed in many separate databases, tables, and records both in electronic and
hard copy form.  

**Contribution**

I was tasked with the responsibility of consolidating many different pieces of
data and inmate records into a single relational database.  Fellow researchers
and the individual who previously started to construct this database felt that
Microsoft Access would be the best database management system to use and felt
that it would be more beneficial than constructing a custom database.  After
setting up all the tables and organizing the data, I queried the data, per
researcher request, using SQL.  The majority of the SQL that I wrote was used to
gather data for analysis for a quarterly report.  I participated in the analysis
of the data in which Microsoft Excel and SPSS was used.  Graphs, charts, and
figures were constructed to present findings in a simple and visually appealing
manor.  This project allowed me to fine tune my SQL and data analysis skills.
The eight reports that were generated are undergoing final review and links to
them will be up shortly.   

__Learned__

This was the first time I was able to apply the computer skills, database
management and SQL, I learned in the classroom to a professional project.  I
learned good data practices which includes how data is recorded, how it is
managed, and it is maintained within a system.  Most importantly, this project
taught me the importance of communication and team work.  I was required to pull
data and do analysis on data from a subject area that I had little experience
with.  Communication with other team members and researchers was important to
getting accurate data and constructing comprehensive reports.  This was another
for me to experience conducting data driven research.
