I was a pathway intern with the Anthropometry and Biomechanics Facility (ABF) group at the National Aeronautics and Space
 Administration (NASA) located at Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.  Unfortunately, COVID19 shut the world down for 
 a bit and the internship went remote.  NASA did a fantastic job at being nibble and flexible and made the best of the situation.
 The internship, although remote, turned out to be a fantastic experience.

My work as an intern consisted of 3D body shape modeling and body composition modeling using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA).
NASA as well as my research lab both utilize 3D body scanning to create 3D meshes of individual for the purpose of analysing shape.
3D scans one of many tools used by NASA to design functional, comfortable, and safe spacesuits.
