There seems to be a particular stigma in academia with regards to publishing
work.  I was led, early on, to believe that in order to get something published
you needed to have a powerful name attached to your work.  In other words, new
publishing individuals would need to have co-authors on their papers who have a
significant academic presence.  As a result, I thought it was near impossible to
publish good quality work that was independent of a lab, advisor, or any
established co-author.

Earlier this year (2019) I started a project that was used to satisfy two
requirements for classes that I was in.  The project was enjoyable and I had
stumbled upon some interesting results.  Further independent work on this
project lead to remarkable results that I felt were worthy of a publication.  I
presented my results to a few professors and fellow grad students and asked them
for input.  The response I received was pretty unanimous
and I was told that it was not worth my time and that others have done what I had
done already.  My literature searches came up short however, and I was not able
to find papers that presented similar work.  I believed that my work was novel
and that it would be a valuable contribution to the scientific community and so
I began the process of taking it to publication.

__Summary__

In my manuscript I showed that it is possible to use the data from smart wrist
wearables and machine learning (AKA "A.I.") to detect the digits an individual
is writing.  I built custom hardware to perform experiments and collect data.
Data was collected by having volunteers write numbers while wearing our device.
I built a machine learning model with the collected data and showed that it had
great accuracy.

They manuscript was submitted to [Hawaii International Conference on Science
Systems (HICSS)](https://hicss.hawaii.edu){:target="_blank"} where it was peer reviewed and
accepted with mandatory changes.  The necessary changes were made, as per the
reviewer requests, and was finally accepted for presentation in January 2020.

__Writing Process__

The accepted manuscript was an extension of work previously done for a class
project.  In that project the main focus was on machine learning and the
building of hardware.  Security was not an issue which we focused on when we
first started this project.  In any case, we thought it was an interesting and
important angle for the manuscript.  We felt that our results could have a more
significant contribution to the security field as opposed to the machine learning
and wearable IOT fields.  Admittedly, HICSS is a fairly broad conference and
there are different tracks to which papers can be submitted.  Each track also
consist of several mini-tracks as well.  Our manuscript was submitted to the
Machine Learning and CyberSecurity mini-track within the Software and Technology
track.  While software development and machine learning are topics I have good
experience in, cybersecurity is out of my field and a little out of my comfort
zone.  This ultimately made the submission and review process interesting and a
great learning experience.  

__Peer Review Process__

Manuscripts submitted to HICSS are subject to peer review.  Since this was my
first paper that I submitted on my own this was also the first time that I was
exposed to the peer review process.  Three subject matter experts and the track
chair reviewed my manuscript.  Manuscripts were scored on a rubric from 1 to 5
where 5 was best.  One reviewer gave me a near perfect review and the reviews
from the other two reviewers were average to sub-average.  Since my manuscript
was submitted under the machine learning and cybersecurity track, two security
experts reviewed my manuscript.  The reviews from these two were strict and they
both stated that I need to cite more sources around security.  In retrospect, my
related work section was on the weaker side.  Although I was told not to waste
my time on this paper because others have done similar things, I found it
difficult to find papers related to my work.  I had difficulty finding previous
work that focused on all three topics which include machine learning, wearable
IOT, and security.  As a result I focused my search on high quality papers that
encompass at least two of the three topic that concerns my paper.   

<!--
Reviewers suggested potential papers to cite by providing direct URL links to
papers.  However, upon further investigation into these papers I discovered
that those suggested papers were written by the reviewers themselves.  This
made me feel uneasy because it felt like the reviewers were soliciting
citations which felt extremely unethical.  The mini-track chair stated, "that
although reviewer suggest articles to use, authors are not required to use them
if they do not pertain to the work at hand".  It felt like the mini-track chair
just stated that to account for instances where reviewers suggeste article for citation
whether for ethical or unethical reasons.  Since this was my first peer review
process I was unsure if this was a common occurrence.  The suggested articles did
not directly relate to my work however, I felt that if I did not include it the
reviewers may ultimately reject my paper upon second review.  I ultimately found
a way to work the reviewer suggested articles into my manuscript and
the manuscript was accepted.

__Finding Funding__

As a PhD student who plans to have a career in academia, this process was a
great moral and confidence booster.  I was shown that I could produce good
quality research and get it published on my own.  I am aware that finding
funding is important in academia whether it is through grants or independent
companies.  Completing the publication process will allow me to experience the
finding funding aspect of academia.  Authors are required to attend and present
their papers at the conference if it is to be published.  Since this work was
done indpendantly of any grant and lab, funding is not available to cover
travel, lodging, and conference fees.  Lack or no existence of funding is not an
excuse to not attend and I am exploring different avenues to help support
my efforts.
