Creativity is my greatest strength because it helps me approach problems and see things in a different light.  It also motivates me to come up with new ways to perform task and accomplish my goals.  Iâ€™ve always enjoyed, drawing,  making 3D sculptures, photography, and compiling time-lapses and films because I am allowed total creative freedom.  I also enjoy the transition of the intangible to the tangible, meaning an idea I think up can become something that someone can watch, hold, and/or see.

With my great interest in art it seems counterintuitive that I received my bachelors of science in biology and a minor in chemistry.  I was always interested in the sciences and enjoyed the challenge it provided. I had hoped to use my degree and work for a bio-tech or pharmaceutical company because I thought creative ideas could lead to research breakthroughs and developments of medical devices or new drug treatments; another example of how an idea can become something tangible.  However, the reality is that drug trials and medical development is a long process and the time it would take for my potential idea come to life would be long.

Computer science and software engineering provides the perfect middle ground for both my interest in science and my creative ability.  The speed at which things takes place in the computer science field is fast which would allow for my ideas to become something real and useful in a shorter time frame.  I can conceive an idea of a program I want to write and it will be ready to use as soon as it is written, debugged, and tested.    A lot of logic and critical thinking goes into developing a program but I would argue that it takes a certain amount of creativity as well.  I view software engineering as a field that involves the design of programs to solving problems.  There are many types of complex problems and while good logical thinking and programming will get you far, I feel that creative ingenuity will help you arrive at better solutions and resulting software.   I hope to learn all aspects of the software engineering process as well as build useful software.
