__Here is the data, make your own conclusions.__

__TLDR__
* Social media data is interesting and may indicate election consensus


Oscar Wilde once wrote “The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about”. This is
along the idea that any press is good press and with Trump in 2016 this seemed to be the case.  The 2016 election showed
 us the effects that social media had on Who becomes president and runs the country. Here we 
can look at trending twitter hashtags as they relate to one of the two major political parties as we near
the 2020 election.  

We gathered the top 50 trending topics on Twitter each day for the past year. These topics are presented
in the form of hashtages (#) and trending words, terms, or phrases.  With this data we can invesitgate
how many days a topic was trending as well as the changes in volume of that topic.  Tweet data was 
provided by [@igetthetags](https://twitter.com/igetthetags) ![Twitter][1.2].


| Tweets Containing: 	|  Volume 	|
|-------------------	|-------:	|
|        Biden       	| 1,042,926 	|
|       Harris       	|  167,056 	|
|        Trump       	| 7,263,062 	|
|        Pence       	|  268,170 	|

<br>
We take no political side and remain objective in our exploration of this data.  In addition, no sentiment
analysis was done on all the tweets to determine if they were for or against a particular political party.
Hence, we reiterate that any press is good press. We used particular search terms to classify a trending
topic into one of two classes; republican or democrat. A hashtag is categorized as democratic if it 
contains any of the following words: <span style="color:blue">'joebiden', 'biden', 'kamalaharris',
'harris', 'democrat'</span>.  A hashtag is categorized as republican if it contains any of the 
following words: <span style="color:red">'donaldtrump', 'trump', 'mikepence', 'pence', 'republican'</span>
. Remember, hashtags do not contain spaces.

The republicans appear to be ahead with respect to social media "buzz".  Several events and news have
instigated many tweets.  Below is a timeline of important events and corresponding tweet volumes with
respect to each party.
