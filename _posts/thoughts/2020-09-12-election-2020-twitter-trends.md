__TLDR__
* Social media data is interesting with respect to the 2020 presidential election
* __Here is the data, make your own conclusions.__


Oscar Wilde once wrote “The only thing worse than being talked about is not being talked about”. This is
along the idea that any press is good press and with Trump in 2016 this seemed to be the case.  The 2016 election showed
 us that social media can have an effect on who become president and runs the country. We also learned in 2016 that polls
 and approval ratings just didn't cut it and it doesn't tell us much.  After all, Trump polled lower in 2016 and then who 
 got to run the country?  Here we
  look at trending twitter hashtags and terms as they relate to one of the two major political parties leading up to the 2020 election.
  Looking at other data sources and taking different angles can always provide valuable insight to the topic at hand.  

We gathered the top 50 trending topics on Twitter each day for the past year. These topics are presented
in the form of hashtages (#) and trending words, terms, or phrases.  With this data we can investigate
how many days a topic was trending as well as the changes in total tweet volume for a topic.  Tweet data was 
provided by [@igetthetags](https://twitter.com/igetthetags) ![Twitter][1.2].


| Tweets Containing: 	|  Volume 	|
|-------------------	|-------:	|
|        Biden       	| 1,042,926 	|
|       Harris       	|  167,056 	|
|        Trump       	| 7,263,062 	|
|        Pence       	|  268,170 	|

We take no political side and remain objective in our exploration.  In addition, no sentiment
analysis was done on all the tweets to determine if they were for or against a particular political party.
Hence, we reiterate that any press is good press and consider all mentions to be positive for one party or another. We used particular search terms to classify a trending
topic into one of two classes; republican or democrat. A hashtag is categorized as democratic if it 
contains any of the following words: <span style="color:blue">'joebiden', 'biden', 'kamalaharris',
'harris', 'democrat'</span>.  A hashtag is categorized as republican if it contains any of the 
following words: <span style="color:red">'donaldtrump', 'trump', 'mikepence', 'pence', 'republican'</span>
. Remember, hashtags do not contain spaces and thus our classification terms do not as well.

The republicans appear to be ahead with respect to social media "buzz".  Several events and news have
instigated many tweets.  Below is a timeline of important events or news and the corresponding tweet volumes colored by political party.

In addition to political classification, we looked at some interesting tweet topics that had high volumes.  The terms
in the following table stemmed from very polarizing events and spurred many political related tweets.

| Tweets Containing: 	|  Volume 	|
|--------------------	|--------:	|
| Debate             	| 3,516,092 	|
| Election           	|  467,029 	|
| BLM                	|   11,295 	|
| BlackLives         	| 3,322,864 	|

The corona virus or COVID19 was a difficult obstacle that the world faced in 2020.  It was also 
a "hot" topic that sparked many conversations and tweets with respect to the virus as well as 
politics.

Despite your political leanings, you can admit that the data is interesting.  Social media is a powerful
information tool and keeping a finger on the pulse of social media may prove to be beneficial.  We will
see early November!
