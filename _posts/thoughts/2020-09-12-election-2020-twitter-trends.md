__Here is the data, make your own conclusions.__

The 2016 election showed us the effects that social media had on the presidential election. Here we 
can look at trending twitter hashtags as they relate to one of the two major political parties as we near
the 2020 election. It is believed, by some, that any press is good press and this may be true for
twitter trends as well.

So what does it mean to be "Top Trending"? A hashtag is considered to be top trending if it is 
one of the top 50 most tweeted hashtag, by volumne, for the day. A hashtag is categorized as democratic
if it contains any of the following words: <span style="color:blue">'joebiden', 'biden', 'kamalaharris',
'harris', 'democrat'</span>.  A hashtag is categorized as republican if it contains any of the
 following words: <span style="color:red">'donaldtrump', 'trump', 'mikepence', 'pence', 
 'republican'</span>. Remember, hashtags do not contain spaces and the categorization search terms,
 previously listed, do not either.
