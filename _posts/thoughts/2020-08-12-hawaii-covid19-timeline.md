Things to think about:

Increase your healthspan via exercise, diet, etc.  This is not often focused on as a recommendation because the results
of wearing a mask and social distancing are more obvious and immediate.  Everyone, unfortunately,
will have some adverse health event.  The healthier you are (i.e. better healthspan) when you encounter an adverse health event, the
better your chances are of coming out of it and regaining your healthspan.
