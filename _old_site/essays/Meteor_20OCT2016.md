Up until the past two weeks, my software engineering course curriculum seemed fairly random.  We’ve coded in three different languages (JavaScript, HTML, CSS), learned how to use the Underscore Library, became accustom to version control systems like Git, and we dabbled in UI frame works like semantic UI.  At times it was tough to follow and often I would forget what I did the previous week because we would be working on something different the next week.  Everything began to make sense once we started working with the Meteor framework.  Meteor is a framework used to build applications and requires everything I’ve learned in the course, thus far, in order to begin to use it.  

Prior to the introduction to Meteor, I was confident in my ability to code in JavaScript, CSS, and HTML.  However, when I initially started using Meteor, my confidence in my ability dropped.  There is a steep learning curve and a lot of things that need to be done in order to get off the ground and start actually coding and building an application.  

The initial setup drew on my knowledge of Git and the command line.  I learned the hard way that it is important to set up your files and directories properly so that it is easier to make changes and revert back if the application crashes.  Building the application required the use of the command line.  I found the build process to be one of the more frustrating and limiting part of the development process.  The initial build of a Meteor app takes a considerable amount of time.  There are different commands that can be executed to help the speed of a build such as the use of bcrypt.  However, as a Windows user I found it hard to implement some of these commands that would help to speed up my builds.  After many hours of exploring forums and getting feedback from classmates, I was able to cut down the build time on one of my computers.

After getting over the hurdle of the setup and the initial build, I began to see the potential of Meteor.  The course has come full circle because we can use everything we have learned with Meteor.  I still find Meteor to be somewhat difficult and I think it is partly attributed to my lack of experience with it.  Initially I had a hard time because I was not sure of the app architecture and how it accesses the database, MongoDB.  I have a better idea of how things interact within Meteor but I still do not have the confidence to say that anything within Meteor is easy.  

One of the reasons I was interested in computer science is because I wanted to build applications that were practical and that people can use and enjoy.  I think learning Meteor is a step toward my goals and intentions.  So far I haven’t found anything that Meteor cannot do and thus I don’t feel like it is limiting in anyway.  Like anything in computer science, practice and hours of staring at a screen will help become proficient in Meteor and an overall better software engineer.
