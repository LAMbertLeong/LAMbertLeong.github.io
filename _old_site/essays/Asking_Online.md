In this day and age, the internet is the first place that most people go to get help.  It is the perfect platform for the exchange of information.  One could seek information passively by visiting websites and get information via text, audio, and/or visuals.  Information can also be accessed actively by posting a question in which someone may answer.  Asking questions over the internet is a great use of resources because it is possible to receive help from someone who may have more expertise that the asker may have not otherwise been able to interact with without the internet because of factors such as location.  However, it is equally as likely that people will respond to request for help with misinformation or mockery.  It is important to establish a professional persona and means of requesting help over the internet in order to receive useful help and avoid the onslaught of “trolls”

Stack Exchange is a website that has attracted the computer science community and allowed the exchange of information, primarily relating to the field of computer science.  Individuals post questions and, often, these questions are answered leaving the asker satisfied and a bit smarter than when they asked the question.  However, no one is required to answer any question and it should be understood that no question deserves an answer.  Due to the freedom of this platform, many questions which vary in range of content and difficulty are asked and often times they are of the same or pertain to the same topic.  In this instance, questions go unanswered because a similar question was already answered and the answered can be mostly applied to similar unanswered ones.  

An essay by Eric Raymond breaks down and analyzes what make a good and bad question and how to formulate request that generate useful answers.  Raymond says that one should build a question so that readers and potential helpers have a feeling that the asker is willing to put in the work, has attempted to find a solution, and has asked the question in a specific way.  After browsing through Stack Exchange, I stubble across a question that is the antithesis of what Raymond suggest for a good question.  The question states “I want to know the reason why this code not run properly”.  This question builds the persona of a person who hasn’t put in much effort and seems as though their assignment is due soon and they are in a panic.  The grammar is not even completely right in the question.  Fortunately for this asker the question was answered with a useful response however, it was long after being ridiculed and mislead by other responded.  It is unclear if the asker was met with a timely response and I would think it wasn’t by the desperate tone of the question.
The asker of the bad question was asking how to validate integer inputs in C using scanf.  I found a user who asked the same question and received more and better responses.  This user asked 

“I have a program which accepts an integer from the user and uses this number in an addition operation.
The code which I am using to accept the number is this:
scanf("%d", &num);
How can I validate the input such that if the user enters a letter or a number with the decimal point, an error message is displayed on the screen?”.

Raymond would consider this a good question.  The user seems to have a good handle on what they are doing, the question is specific, and it shows effort on the user’s part.  The asker was rewarded with useful and timely responses.
It is likely that I will encounter problems which I will need help to derive a viable solution and it is also likely that I will not have a colleague or professor that I can access for knowledge.  At this point the internet will be a good alternative.  However, I must present myself in a way that demonstrates competence and professionalism.  Following Raymond’s guides to asking questions will benefit me and allow my questions to be met with professional and insightful responses.  Posting questions online to a forum or message board is not something I currently do when I need help and it will probably remain as my last resort in the future as well. If in the instance that I have exhausted other resources, I will know how to conduct myself online and present questions that will provide me valuable answers.
