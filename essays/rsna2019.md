After joining [John Shepherd](https://shepherdresearchlab.org/about/our-team/)
and his team at the University of Hawaii Cancer Center in November of 2018, I
had begun working on a dual xray mammography project known as the [3 Compartment
Breast (3CB)](https://shepherdresearchlab.org/research/3cb/).  The goal of 3CB
is to be able to seperately view the different tissue componets of the breast
and possible lesions.  These components include lipid, water, and protein. In
order to accurately derive the three components, accurate geometrical and
thickness measurments of the breast is needed.  My work consisted of developing
a technique to accurately estimate the breast measurments that were need for our 3CB
algortihm.

Abstracts for the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA) annual conference
we due in the April and we believed that this would be a good oppurtunity to
present my work and for me to gain exposure to the field of radiology.  My abstract was
accepted and I was awarded an oral presentation.
