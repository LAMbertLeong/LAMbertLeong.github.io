Learning new UI frameworks have given new meaning to the phrase “love hate relationship”.  Recently, I have been working with the Semantic UI framework and my first impressions of it were that it is awful and useless.  Prior to using the Semantic UI framework, I had only done minimal coding with HTML and CSS.  As I was becoming comfortable and proficient coding webpages with raw HTML and CSS I was instructed to adopt the use of a UI framework.  Immediately my proficiency went down despite the help of resources like pluralsight.  Many attribute learning a new UI framework to be analogous to learning a new programming language.  I however, found it to be slightly more difficult than that.  There aren’t many other resources or place to go for help on specific frameworks like Semantic UI.  When I am trying to accomplish something while learning a new language I search in place like StackOverFlow for examples that are similar to the problem I am trying to solve.  StackOverFlow did not provide much help with Semantic UI and it is probably because it wasn’t designed specifically to cater to UI framework questions.  

The documentation is always the first place you should look when learning a new language and need help.  At first I found Semantic UI’s documentation to be fairly confusing partly due to the fact that I didn’t know how to properly navigate through all the different features.  Unfamiliarity with the Semantic UI site significantly affected my ability to quickly compose a website.  I found that I was spending more time looking through the Semantic UI website for pieces of code I could use to get a certain feature on my webpage.  Learning this framework took a lot of trial and error.  I would constantly add and remove snippets of Semantic UI code to see how things worked and if it produced the result I wanted.  I hated this process and it made the overall experience of building a webpage a little stale.

Like anything else, practice makes perfect.  As I continued to use Semantic UI more and more I began to become more proficient in it.  I know what classes to use and how to obtain a finished product I envisioned.  Continued use will help me gain more confidence in the framework.  I see its potential and usefulness because it allows you to create a lot more with less actual coding.  Until I become completely oriented in the framework it won’t necessarily be my favorite thing to work with however when it produces exactly what I want, I enjoy it.  Although I have not used any other frameworks prior to Semantic UI, it is hard for me to say if it is easier of harder to learn.  The time and effort I am putting in now to learn this framework will most likely pay off down the road and I will be able to efficiently construct appealing webpages using this current UI framework.
