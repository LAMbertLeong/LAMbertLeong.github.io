There seems to be a particular stigma in academia with regards to publishing work.  I was led, early on, to believe that in order to get something published you needed to have a powerful name attached to your work.  In other words, new publishing individuals would need to have co-authors on their papers who have accumulated a good amount of academic clout over the course of their career.  As a result, I thought it was near impossible to publish good quality work that was independent of a lab, advisor, or any established co-author.

Earlier this year (2019) I started a project that was used to satify two of the classes that I was in.  The project was enjoyable and I had stumbled upon some interesting results.  Further indpendent work on this project lead to remarkable results that I felt were worthy of a publication.  I presented my results to a few professors and fellow grad students and I asked them if my results were publish worthy.  The response I recieved was unanimous and I was told that it was not worth my time and that other have done what I had done already.  My literature searches came up short however, and I was not able to find papers that presented similar work.  I believed that my work was novel and that it would be a valuble contribution to the scientific commpunity and so I began the process of taking it to publication.
