Our app was called CRAM and it allowed students to organize times to study with one another.  CRAM is a web app developed using the Meteor framework and deployed to galaxy.  I became familiar and comfortable with the Meteor framework and knowledgeable of the MongoDB database structure.  I have become more comfortable coding in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to the point where I enjoy it.

This app was developed as a team project and Git and Github proved to be powerful tools that allowed us to work efficiently.  We developed an organization, created a project, and set up milestones that we strove to accomplish.  Github helped the development process and allowed us to work together without having to actually be together physically.    

This project was the result of everything we have learned thus far in software engineering.  The development of this app has taught me how to develop and work as a team.  It also has helped me get exposure to different coding languages and frameworks.  I have since gained confidence in my software engineering abilities and would feel comfortable taking on more software engineering opportunities in the future.
