summary: Eyegenix LLC was a start up located in Honolulu Hawaii with the mission
to cure corneal blindness. The cornea is the most transplanted organ worldwide
and at Eyegenix we developed a bio-synthetic transplantable cornea.  Our class
II medical device's advantage over donor corneas in that host versus graft
interactions were non-issue.

**Overview**

I worked for Eyegenix from 2015 to 2018 as a researcher.  Eyegenix was a biotech
start up company located in Honolulu Hawaii that developed bio-engineered
corneas (BEC).  We often collaborated and sub-contracted efforts out to those at
Johns Hopkins  Wilmer Eye Institute.  Together with parallel efforts we
developed BECs that were sucessful in live transplant.  I held two roles while
working at Eyegenix.  I was a part of the manufacturing team and I was incharge
of running biocompatibility assays on developed BECs.

**Manufacturing**

The BEC cosisted of a protein polymer base and units were shaped using injection
molding.  Eyegenix was in posession of one of two clean rooms on the island of
Oahu and this is where units were manufatured.Manufacturing required great
dexterity along with familiarity with the feel and viscosity of the polymer
during the cross linking stage.  As a result, units were manufactured by hand
and attempts to automate presented more problems than solutions. As a part of
the manufaturing team, I was granted the privilege of working with the polymer
and building units for transplant. Additionally, I participated in the
development of new polymer formulations.  New polymers were formulated with a
goal to improve strength, elasticity, biocompatibility, and clarity.  Deriving
new formulations allowed me to exercise my biochemistry knowledge in a way that
produced tangible and testible results.

**Biocompatibility Testing** 

I was originally hired to performe cell and tissue culture task.  Two
biocompatibility assays were develped to assess how BECs will perform in-vivo.
Test were performed in a bio-safety level 2 rated lab using imortalized human
 and primary rabbit cornea cells.
