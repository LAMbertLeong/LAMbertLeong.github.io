summary: Eyegenix LLC was a start up located in Honolulu Hawaii with the mission to cure corneal blindness. The cornea is the most transplanted organ worldwide and at Eyegenix we developed a bio-synthetic transplantable cornea.  Our class II medical device's advantage over donor corneas in that host versus graft interactions were non-issue.
