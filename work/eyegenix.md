summary: Eyegenix LLC was a start up located in Honolulu Hawaii with the mission to cure corneal blindness. The cornea is the most transplanted organ worldwide and at Eyegenix we developed a bio-synthetic transplantable cornea.  Our class II medical device's advantage over donor corneas in that host versus graft interactions were non-issue.

**Overview**

I worked for Eyegenix from 2015 to 2018 as a researcher.  Eyegenix was a biotech start up company located in Honolulu Hawaii that developed bio-engineered corneas (BEC).  We often collaborated and sub-contracted efforts out to those at Johns Hopkins  Wilmer Eye Institute.  Together with parallel efforts we developed BECs that were sucessful in live transplant.  I held two roles while working at Eyegenix.  I was a part of the manufacturing team and I was incharge of running biocompatibility assays on developed BECs.
